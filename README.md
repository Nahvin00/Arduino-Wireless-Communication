# Arduino-Wireless-Communication
This repository contains the Arduino sketches for establishing wireless communication between an Arduino Nano and an Arduino Uno using nRF24L01 modules. The Arduino Nano acts as the master and sends data to the Arduino Uno, while the Arduino Uno serves as the slave and receives data from the Arduino Nano.
